# rare_variants

This is a pilot study for estimating heritability across different minor allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium thresholds in whole genome sequencing data.

This project is run in a jupyter notebook on Biowulf, NIH's slurm HPC cluster. more details and steps are included in the jupyter notebook, rare_variant_analysis.ipynb. 

supplementary functions (such as running bash and controlling output in the notebook) are called from myfunctions.py.

Keep in mind, this is a somewhat computationally expensive pipeline and requires parallel processing with swarm.
